# Mood Brew
For our project, we have created a drink and food generator based on your mood. There are 3 mood options on the top of our interface. When a user selects a mood category, they will then receive 2 alcohol options catered to that specific mood. A coin flip API will randomly select their type of alcohol. Once alcohol is selected a randomly generated drink and food option appears.

## User Story
